Business Need:  Our recruiters need an efficient and streamlined way to schedule interviews with
candidates. The current manual process involves back-and-forth communication to
find suitable time slots, leading to delays and potential miscommunication. We want
to automate the interview scheduling process within the Recruitment App, allowing
recruiters to easily send interview invitations.  


Functional Requirements:  

1. Interview Scheduling Trigger:
   The interview scheduling process should be from the Job Application record layout page on clicking a schedule Interview button and
assigning the recruiter as the interviewer. 
2. Email Notifications:
 The system should automatically send email notifications to both the selected candidate(s) and the assigned interviewer. 
 
The email notifications should include:

Candidate's name and contact information 
Interviewer's name
Proposed interview date and time
Interview location (if applicable)
Any additional instructions or preparation materials. This
should be fetched from the Position object’s new field named :
Additional Instructions / Preparation materials.


Technical Requirements:

  Salesforce Flow:

  Develop a screen-Flow to ease the interview scheduling process.
  The Flow should be initiated by a custom button or action on the Job Application object's page layout.

 Utilize Flow elements to:
   Retrieve the selected Job Application record and their associated Candidate and create a job Interview record (new Custom Object).
   Prompt to select an interview date and time.
   Generate and send email notifications to the candidate and the interviewer using email templates.
   The candidate should be pre-populated by default with candidate of the Job Application on which the button was clicked.
   Adhere to CloudKaptan Standards & Guideline - Flow v1.0 

 Email Templates:
There should be two different email Templates. One for the Candidate and the other for the recruiter.
 Design email templates for interview invitations containing candidate details , recruiter name and the schedule when the interview
schedule details.
